## Introduction
The Incomplete Discord Chat Bot is a work-in-progress project designed to respond to specific prompts in a Discord server. While currently incomplete, the bot is intended to have the ability to send messages to a designated channel based on specific triggers.

## Features (Planned)
**Prompt Responses**: The bot is designed to respond to three predetermined prompts with different messages.
**Channel Interaction**: It should be able to send messages to a specified channel within the Discord server (not working as intended).

## Usage (Current State)
As of now, the Discord chatbot is in an incomplete state. Key feature, specific channel interaction via server ID, is not functional.
